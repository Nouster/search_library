# search_library

Library Search PHP Code
This PHP code retrieves search results for games from a library of games. It filters the library by the search parameter and displays the results in a visually pleasing format. The code also makes the search case-insensitive and limits the game descriptions to 150 characters.

Usage
To use this code, you will need to have a library of games and modify the $libraryGames array in the library.php file to include your games' data. Then, place the library.php and search.php files in the same directory on your server.

To search for a game, navigate to search.php and enter your query in the search bar. The results will be displayed on the same page.

Dependencies
This code requires PHP 7.4 or later.
